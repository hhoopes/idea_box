Idea Box is a Turing assignment allotted 3-1/2 days to quickly ramp up skills in JS and AJAX with an internal API. It's fully realized through AJAX in a single page and allows a user to create, edit, and delete ideas, as well as upvote and downvote the quality of the idea. Additionally, a realtime search provides case-insensitive results without page reloads.
